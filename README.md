# Mekton Online
An idea I had for a Mekton Zeta/ Zeta Plus MMO engine.

This document, as well as all others in this repository, is subject to change.

There would be three executables:

## 1. The client
  How you play the game.
## 2. The server
  For running the game.
## 3. The editor
  For editing settings.
